=========================== Goblin model named "Gawblin" =========================================
This model has been created by the user "Batuhan13" available at Sketchfab.com (https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/goblin-warrior-852c928a166e471a8dc8e592ff25a21a).
We have changed the model format to wavefront (.obj) and therefore edited the resulting material file so that it includes necessary textures. The textures format has been altered as well to a DDS format.
Finally, all files (except the mtl file) has been encrypted in this project. Users will not be able to use the model if they do not decrypt the assets.
The model is used under the creative commons Attribution 4.0 (as described here https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
